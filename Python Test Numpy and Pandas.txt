#1. Create Simple 1-D array and check type and check data types in array.

import numpy as np
arr = np.array([10, 21, 13, 33, 6, 1])
print('Array:', arr)
print('Datatype:', arr.dtype)


#2. Create a null vector of size 10 but the fifth value which is 1.

s=np.array([int(x==4) for x in range(10)])
print(s)


#3. Create a vector with values ranging from 10 to 49.

import numpy as np
a = np.arange(10,49)
print("Values:")
print(a)


#4. Reverse a vector (first element becomes last).

import numpy as np
ar = np.arange(10, 30)
print("Array:")
print(ar)
print("Reverse array:")
ar = ar[::-1]
print(ar)


#5. Find indices of non-zero elements from [1,2,0,0,4,0].

import numpy as np
arr = [1,2,0,0,4,0]
nonzero = np.nonzero(arr)
print ("Indices of non zero elements : ", nonzero)


#6. Write a Pandas program to calculate the frequency counts of each unique value of a given series.
import pandas as pd
series = pd.Series(data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,3,9,5])
print(series)
print(series.
value_counts())

#8. Write a Pandas program to get the items of a given series not present in another given series.

import pandas as pd
series1 = pd.Series([2, 4, 8, 20, 10, 47, 99])
series2 = pd.Series([1, 3, 6, 4, 10, 99, 50])
print("Series1:")
print(series1)
print("Series2:")
print(series2)
print("Items of s1 not present in s2:")
result = series1[~series1.isin(series2)]
print(result)


#9. Write a Pandas program to create a subset of a given series based on value and condition.
import pandas as pd
ser1 = pd.Series([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15])
print("Series:")
print(ser1)
print("Subset of the above Series:")
n = 5
ser2 = ser1[ser1 < n]
print(ser2)
